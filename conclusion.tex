\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced \interface\ a novel presentation interface to help presenters deliver flexible and engaging presentations by combining inking with pre-authored slides. We proposed a set of modeless inking interactions to help presenters reveal, annotate and create extra space during a presentation. We evaluated our interface from the perspective of presenters and the audience by comparing it against two baseline interfaces, representing conventional slide and inking tools. Presenters found our interface easy to use both during preparation and delivery. Especially for text-heavy, process-driven content, both presenters and audience preferred presentations delivered using \interface.
