\section{Conclusion}
This paper introduces \interface, a novel presentation interface that combines inking interactions with pre-authored slides to help presenters deliver flexible and engaging presentations.

Our modeless inking interactions allow presenters to reveal, annotate and create extra space during a presentation. We evaluated our interface from the perspective of presenters and the audience by comparing it against two baseline interfaces, representing conventional slide and inking tools. Presenters found our interface easy to use both during preparation and delivery. In particular, for text-heavy, process-driven content, both presenters and audience preferred presentations delivered using \interface.

In light of these findings, we believe our inking interactions could be a valuable addition to existing slide-based presentation tools.
