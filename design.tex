\section{Design Principles}

Minimize cognitive load of the presenter. Should be modeless.
In previous study of inking during presentation [cite], presenters use
features (e.g., color, highlighting) parsimoniously.

\wil{Before getting into the details of the method, I think we should
  describe the key aspects of our design (fine-grained reveal and
  space manipulation, right?) and connect them to our design principles.}
