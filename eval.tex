\section{User Evaluation}

We evaluate \interface\ from two perspectives: from the presentation
author's point of view and from the audience's point of view. 

\wil{If we have time, it could be useful to include even an informal
  evaluation of the space manipulation features. Maybe just give users
  a script that includes explicit ``improvisations'' beyond the
  prepared content and ask for qualitative feedback?}

\subsection{Authoring}

Users create presentations using three different tools, PPT with slide animations, PPT with only inking, and our tool. We test on three different types of slides.
