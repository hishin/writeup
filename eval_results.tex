\subsection{Discussion of Study Results}
Overall, presenters found \interface easy to use for setting up and delivering presentations. They were satisfied with the quality of the presentations recorded using our interface, and emphasized that the appearance of real time inking had an engaging effect. The preference of presentation tool depended on the content type. Both the presenters and the audiences preferred \interface for text-centered or process-driven content. Below we discuss each of these aspects in more detail.

\textbf{}\\
Presenters found it easiest to set up the slides using our interface \val{(Figure)}.  

1. Easier to prepare using \interface.
2. As easy to present
3. Presenters were satisfied with the result. Audience satisfaction depended on subject. 
4. Content-tool affects each other.
