\section{Introduction}

Presentation technology has a significant influence on how we learn and teach. 
%Among other roles, presentation media allow persistent display of information and serve as a shared view between the presenter and the audience \cite{anderson2004beyond}. 
Today, there are mainly two types of presentation technology used in classroom instruction: electronic slides and blackboards. 

Electronic slides provide a means of showing information-rich content with improved organization by advanced preparation of material. However, pre-authored slides come at the expense of the ability to freely adjust the presentation during performance. Presenters not only need to prepare the content, but also determine ahead of time the order and granularity of how things will be displayed (i.e., by setting up animation effects). It is difficult to add content or change the order during delivery, for instance, in response to the audience. It is also difficult to deliberately pace the presentation using animation. Slide lectures tend to show more information in a shorter period of time than blackboard lectures \cite{lanir2008observing}.

Writing on blackboards or, more generally, inking in real time is a direct and intuitive way of communication, but doing it well in the context of a presentation is challenging. Writing and talking at the same time is cognitively demanding. Bad handwriting and poor layouts are common problems expressed by both the presenters and the audience. It is also difficult to incorporate complex diagrams or images.

Some presenters blend the two modes of presentation, for example, by projecting slides onto a board and inking on top of them. Recently, PowerPoint and Keynote, also allow presenters to ink in presentation mode. However, in these approaches, ink and slide remain as separate layers, each retaining its own drawbacks. Slide contents remain unadjustable and inking in real time is still challenging.  

To address these problems, we propose \interface \footnote{A charm for revealing invisible ink\cite{rowling1997harry}}, a presentation interface that combines the advantages of slides and inking.
%
In \interface, presenters use pre-authored slides to prepare the presentation. However, instead of specifying animations beforehand, presenters use inking interactions to flexibly display slide contents on demand. By inking, presenters can reveal pre-authored contents at a deliberate pace as if writing in real time. They can also add improvised annotations. Finally, they can create blank space insider the slide to insert new content. All of these functions are provided as modeless interactions.
% contents to be inked at presentation time. During the preparation phase, presenters can take time to write neatly, plan the layout carefully, and also include typed text or images as they would for a slide presentation. Unlike slide presentations, presenters need not determine beforehand the precise order or granularity of how these contents will be displayed (i.e., animation order and groups). Instead, presenters simply decide which parts of the content is initially hidden from the audience. During presentation, the hidden contents are visible to the presenters and serve as a guide. Inking either reveals the pre-prepared contents to the audience or appears as an impromptu annotation depending on the context. Presenters can adjust the content, its order, and pace on demand by deciding whether, when, and how to reveal each part. We also provide an interaction to modify the layout on-the-fly by creating or reducing blank space, similar to \cite{yoon2013texttearing}. In order to minimize the cognitive load during presentation, all of these interactions are provided as modeless pen interactions. \\

We evaluate our interface from the perspective of presenters and the audience, and compare them against two baselines, representing conventional electronic slides and plain inking. Presenters found \interface\ easy to use for preparing and delivering presentations. They were also satisfied with the quality of the presentation produced using our interface. Preference between presentation interfaces depended on the type of content, both for the presenter and the audience.

To summarize, we present the following contributions: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item We present \interface, a presentation interface that uses inking as a main mode of interaction to present electronic slides in a flexible manner.
  \item We evaluate the interface from the presenters' and audiences' perspective and compare it against two baseline interfaces. 
  \item Based on formative interviews and observations from our user study, we discuss design directions for future presentation interfaces. 
\end{itemize}

% \textbf{We propose inking as a main modality to present slide contents in a continuous, flexible and direct manner}. By inking over to reveal content, users regain flexibility, continuity and direct control over the presentation style, without losing the elegance of the prepared content.  
%Slides are fit for scripted presentations.

%There are previous work to blend the two modes. [Classroom Presenter] or recent versions of [PowerPoint] allow you to ink on slides. But these tools treat the two modes as separate. Ink and slide remain separate layers retaining their characteristics. The slide layer remains rigid and fixed; and ink is placed on top of it.\\

%35mm slide projectors first came into widespread use during the 1950s, but recently the popularization of slide authoring tools like PowerPoint, Keynote or Google Slides made electronic slides became much more common and easy. Despite its advantages--e.g., easy to share, archive, include multimedia--slides also have critical drawbacks. 
%(1) Slide presentations are \textbf{rigid}: All of the editing and preparation is done ahead of time and fixed at the time of the presentation. There is no flexibility to change the order or content of the presentation during performance. 
%(2) Slide presentations are \textbf{discrete}: Information is divided and presented in chunks. First the entire content is divided into separate slides, and within each slide text or graphics are presented in chunks, usually using animation effects. The appearance or transition of information is sudden and discrete.
%(3) Slide presentations are \textbf{indirect}: The action of the presenter (i.e., pressing "next" to advance the slide) is removed from the effect on the content. For example, this makes it easy for presenters to forget or skip an animation sequence.\\
%
%Inking on surface is an alternative or supplement. Inking includes blackboard or transparency and overhead projector. Inking complements the characteristics of slides. Inking is flexible, continuous and direct, but this has its own downsides.
%(1) Inking is \textbf{flexible} since all of the presentation is done on the fly. But, this means there is a lot of cognitive overload for the presenter in order to decide the content, layout and order of the presentation on the fly. 
%(2) Inking is \textbf{continuous}: Since the presenter writes or draws in real time, content is presented in a continuous way. This is useful for information-loaded contents or where order within the content is important, for example, derivation of a math formula or describing a temporal process. However, it is difficult to time the presentation or present a lot of information. Inking lectures tend to be slower paced [citation].
%Finally, (3) inking is direct. Users actions (drawing, erasing, underlying) are all directly translated into content. This requires a lot of attention, skill on the part of the presenter. Often, presenters are reluctant to write because of their messy handwriting. Also content is limited to text or simple diagrams.



% Mainly two types of presentation technology used in classroom (and online?) instruction: drawing on surface and creating electronic slides.

% Drawing on surface is engaging (cite), and flexible (improvise). But it can be hard to talk and draw at the same time. Also, hard to alter the pace; can't speed up if you have to draw everything.

% Electronic allow authors to prepare content ahead of time, which makes it less taxing to present (just hit next). But it's also less flexible; can't change the order or granularity of animations. Moreover, if you want very fine-grained reveals, that takes a lot of effort at preparation time.

% Aparecium combines convenience of pre-authored slides with the flexibility and engaging quality of inking. The one key idea is to use inking as a form of fine-grained reveal. Authors prepare content ahead of time, then indicate which parts should be hidden. At presentation time, authors ink, but their strokes are used to reveal corresponding parts of the underlying content. The other key idea is to allow for convenient space manipulation. This approach has several benefits:
% + Authors can prepare as much or as little as they want
% + They have flexibility at presentation time to reveal at different granularities and orders
% + Inked content is always neatly written and arranged (at least as well as the prepared version)
% + No modes: revealing and adding new annotations are all done with the same inking interaction, and user does not have to switch pen colors or styles

% Main contributions are in reveal algorithm, space-pushing technique. We evaluate presentation experience and quality of results compared to baselines.
