\subsection{2. Supporting Electronic Inking}

\textbf{2.1 Beautification}
Igarishi97--PEGASUS: considers geometric constraints (e.g., parallel, horizontal, coincidence) to support rapid geometric designs.\\
Fiser15--ShipShape: generalizes geometric constraints to general Bezier curves\\
Hse05: recognize hand-drawn multi-stroke symbols and convert them to pre-existing shapes in PowerPoint.\\
Xie14--PortraitSketch: beautify portraits based on underlying image.\\
Su-EzSketch: refine line drawing based on underlying image.\\
 
\textbf{2.2 Digital Notetaking}
